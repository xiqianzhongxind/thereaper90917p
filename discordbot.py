######################## ZTM DISCORD BOT #########################
# This project will start off simple and as we progress we can make it more complex with cogs(OOP)

# import discord.py first

# first we need to get the bot to join a discord server
# after we connect to a discord server we will print all the users that join or leave the server
# after this we will start with basic commands
# the first command will be a simple reply from the bot example if we do !ping it should reply "pong"


######################## Packages we will be starting with #########################
# Discord.py for documentation refer to  https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


######################## IMPORTAN NOTICES WHEN USING DISCORD.PY #########################

# Discord.py was rewritten the latest version is known as (rewrite) due to this i recommend using python 3.7 and up to avoid errors/conflicts

client.run(os.environ['DISCORD_TOKEN'])  # this uses a OS Environment Variable so the token isn't exposed
