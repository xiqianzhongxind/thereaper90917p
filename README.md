# ZTM-Python-Discord-Bot-Almuni

## A Discord bot written in Python by and for the ZTM community

### Packages we will be starting with:
* discord.py: View documentation [here.](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### NOTE:
* The latest version of discord.py is v1.3.1. Due to this, using python v3.7 and up is recommended so as to avoid errors/conflicts.

* The goal behind this bot is to help members find projects. Each project will be categorized under Beginner, Intermediate or Advanced.

* Moderators will have the ability to scrape the web for discovering new programming projects. Each project will be ranked and then properly categorized. Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced projects will be stored as lists and accessed per user. As the user completes the projects, they will receive a score and the project will be removed from the list for that user only.

* Requirements:
	* tinydb v3.15.2
	* discord v1.0.1
	* praw v6.5.1
	* python v3.7
	* discord.py v1.2.5
	* requests v2.22.0
	* beautifulsoup4 v4.8.2

**Here are a few basic bot commands:**
* !Beginner
